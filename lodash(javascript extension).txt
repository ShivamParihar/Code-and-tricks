1)install lodash for a project
->npm install lodash

2)install browserify
->npm install -g browserify
here -g represents global

3)now every time you update any javascript file write
->browserify javascript_file_name > bundle.js
ex ->browserify demo.js > bundle.js 

4)We can run the project live using 
->live-server

**don't ever upload the node-module folder on the github as it is very big. As we have given it's reference in the package.json file, any one who clone our project just has to run (->npm install) to get get folder eaisly.

**Also as we have to repeat step 3 and step 4 every time we make a change in javascript file just write these in the package.json file.
"scripts": {
    "build": "browserify demo.js > bundle.js && live-server"
},

and we just have to run (->npm run build) in place of the two steps
